# My Role

My title is Manager, Health Promotion and Community Engagement. I am part of our management team along with Racquel Simpson, Program Manager & Strategist, Maame Boateng, Program Manager, and Paul Bailey, Executive Director. My work involves driving our strategic direction via health promotion efforts. I spend time engaging with a variety of stakeholders deciding how best to collaborate and expand our work. I also spend a lot of time developing and maintaining key partnerships. Lastly, I do quite a bit of administrative and project management tasks.

# My Hours

My regular working hours are 9 am - 5 pm. I work virtually every day, except the day that we are in the office together. However, I drop into the office on other days once in a while. I also work outside of these hours (some evenings and some Saturdays) to accommodate the needs of some of our stakeholders, and I am happy to do so! Lastly, you may see me online, answering emails, or working on a document at random hours. Sometimes, I like to play catch up outside of my regular working hours and I don't expect you to do the same. :) I take my breaks whenever I feel necessary and whenever makes the most sense for the flow of my day. Whenever I am off, you will know because it will be outlined in my calendar ahead of time. 

# Communication

I check my email first and my Slack second, although I check both quite often. I check my phone a lot less than my email and Slack, however feel free to call or text me as needed (647.204.3578). If I am not able to respond to a message or email, I will let you know that I have received it and will be getting back to you. We can also set up video meetings whenever necessary, either on or off camera. I LOVE documents and processes so I try to keep us as organized as possible in our Google Drive since those documents add up! Communication styles vary and so I am happy to figure out communication preferences that work for us all. 

# My Style

I went to school for Social Sciences and I also went to teacher's college. The majority of my background is in front line community organizing work. I have lived in experience with quite a few marginalized identities. I am VERY passionate about being a supporter for and working in solidarity with vulnerable and historically oppressed communities. If you ever need space to be held for you to chat about things happening outside of work, I have capacity for that and I am happy to do so. Otherwise, when it comes to my work style, I prefer to know more information than less so that I can ensure that we are all on the same. I love when folks over explain themselves and ask too many questions. I will always make space and time to receive your feedback and welcome it! We will have check ins often and debriefing sessions not only about the work that we are doing but also the processes surrounding how we are working together as a team.

# My Strengths

I am excellent at community engagement, outreach, developing partnerships, event administration, facilitation and training. I love learning new systems, platforms, and processes for strengthening my work flow and increasing my efficiency. I am inquisitive and will ask questions as necessary and I am really great at receiving feedback!

# My Challenges

I am not so great at visual design, working at or over capacity, or working without clear and shared objectives. I find it challenging to leave a task unfinished.

# I Love

I love enjoying downtime: naps, rest, watching shows, celebrity gossip, reading. I spend quite a bit of time hosting my family (I'm an auntie!) and going out to eat with my friends. I am very much into yoga and other wellness healing practices. I try to spend as much time outside as possible. I love working in service of community and always have a couple of freelance projects going on. My favourite book is Meridian - Alice Walker and my favourite movie is Crooklyn - Spike Lee. Lastly, I love any salty snacks and bubbly beverages. :)

# I Don't Love

I don't love injustice, being tired (if there is a 'hangry' term for sleepiness, then that is what I get), and watermelon.
